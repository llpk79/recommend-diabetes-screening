# Diabetes screening recommendation tool.

Diabetes  is a serious, but manageable disease affecting ['over 100 million'](
https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2017/p0718-diabetes-report.html), or around 9.4% of United States citizens in 2017. 

Diagnosing diabetes requires blood draws, fasting and can take several visits to the clinic. It is important to 
develop tools to recommend screening to those most likely to have diabetes in order to reduce the hassle and pain of 
diagnosis and effectively allocate resources to where they are likely to be most effective. 

Using basic health screening and a machine learning algorithm called the XG Boost Classifier, we attempt to recommend 
screening as a fast, low cost method of determining likelihood of a diabetes diagnosis. 

In this limited project, only data from King County, WA is used. Using more data and more targeted survey 
question could lead to better results and, perhaps, an effective clinical tool.
